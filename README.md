**S2Graph**
===================

**S2Graph** is a **graph database** designed to handle transactional graph processing at scale. Its REST API allows you to store, manage and query relational information using **edge** and **vertex** representations in a **fully asynchronous** and **non-blocking** manner. This document covers some basic concepts and terms of S2Graph as well as help you get a feel for the S2Graph API.

**Quick Start (with Vagrant)**
==

S2Graph comes with a Vagrantfile that lets you spin up a virtual environment for test and development purposes.
(On setting up S2Graph in your local environment directly, please refer to [Quick Start in Your Local Environment](https://steamshon.gitbooks.io/s2graph-book/content/getting_started.html).)

You will need [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) installed on your system.

With everything ready, let's get started by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/kakao/s2graph.git
cd s2graph
vagrant up
vagrant ssh

// in the virtual environment..
cd s2graph
activator 'project s2rest_play' run
```

**Your First Graph**
==

As a toy problem, let's try to create the backend for a simple timeline of a new social network service. (Think of a simplified version of Facebook's Timeline. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)
You will be able to manage "friends" and "posts" of a user with simple S2Graph queries.


1. First, we need a name for the new service.

  Why don't we call it Kakao Favorites?
  ```
  curl -XPOST localhost:9000/graphs/createService -H 'Content-Type: Application/json' -d '
  {"serviceName": "KakaoFavorites", "compressionAlgorithm" : "gz"}
  '
  ```

  Make sure the service is created correctly.
  ```
  curl -XGET localhost:9000/graphs/getService/KakaoFavorites
  ```

2. Next, we will need some friends.

  In S2Graph, relationships are defined as Labels.

  Create a ```friends``` label with the following ```createLabel``` API call:
  ```
  curl -XPOST localhost:9000/graphs/createLabel -H 'Content-Type: Application/json' -d '
  {
    "label": "friends",
    "srcServiceName": "KakaoFavorites",
    "srcColumnName": "userName",
    "srcColumnType": "string",
    "tgtServiceName": "KakaoFavorites",
    "tgtColumnName": "userName",
    "tgtColumnType": "string",
    "isDirected": "false",
    "indices": [],
    "props": [],
    "consistencyLevel": "strong"
  }
  '
  ```
  Check the label:
  ```
  curl -XGET localhost:9000/graphs/getLabel/friends
  ```

  Now that the label ```friends``` is ready, we can store friend entries.

  Entries of a label are called edges, and you can add edges with the ```edges/insert``` API:
  ```
  curl -XPOST localhost:9000/graphs/edges/insert -H 'Content-Type: Application/json' -d '
  [
    {"from":"Elmo","to":"Big Bird","label":"friends","props":{},"timestamp":1444360152477},
    {"from":"Elmo","to":"Ernie","label":"friends","props":{},"timestamp":1444360152478},
    {"from":"Elmo","to":"Bert","label":"friends","props":{},"timestamp":1444360152479},

    {"from":"Cookie Monster","to":"Grover","label":"friends","props":{},"timestamp":1444360152480},
    {"from":"Cookie Monster","to":"Kermit","label":"friends","props":{},"timestamp":1444360152481},
    {"from":"Cookie Monster","to":"Oscar","label":"friends","props":{},"timestamp":1444360152482}
  ]
  '
  ```

  Query friends of Elmo with ```getEdges``` API:
  ```
  curl -XPOST localhost:9000/graphs/getEdges -H 'Content-Type: Application/json' -d '
  {
      "srcVertices": [{"serviceName": "KakaoFavorites", "columnName": "userName", "id":"Elmo"}],
      "steps": [
        {"step": [{"label": "friends", "direction": "out", "offset": 0, "limit": 10}]}
      ]
  }
  '
  ```

  Now query friends of Cookie Monster:
  ```
  curl -XPOST localhost:9000/graphs/getEdges -H 'Content-Type: Application/json' -d '
  {
      "srcVertices": [{"serviceName": "KakaoFavorites", "columnName": "userName", "id":"Cookie Monster"}],
      "steps": [
        {"step": [{"label": "friends", "direction": "out", "offset": 0, "limit": 10}]}
      ]
  }
  '
  ```

3. Users of Kakao Favorites will be able to post URLs of their favorite websites.

  We will need a new label ```post``` for this data:
  ```
  curl -XPOST localhost:9000/graphs/createLabel -H 'Content-Type: Application/json' -d '
  {
    "label": "post",
    "srcServiceName": "KakaoFavorites",
    "srcColumnName": "userName",
    "srcColumnType": "string",
    "tgtServiceName": "KakaoFavorites",
    "tgtColumnName": "url",
    "tgtColumnType": "string",
    "isDirected": "true",
    "indices": [],
    "props": [],
    "consistencyLevel": "strong"
  }
  '
  ```

  Now, insert some posts of our users:
  ```
  curl -XPOST localhost:9000/graphs/edges/insert -H 'Content-Type: Application/json' -d '
  [
    {"from":"Big Bird","to":"www.kakaocorp.com/en/main","label":"post","props":{},"timestamp":1444360152477},
    {"from":"Big Bird","to":"github.com/kakao/s2graph","label":"post","props":{},"timestamp":1444360152478},
    {"from":"Ernie","to":"groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/s2graph","label":"post","props":{},"timestamp":1444360152479},
    {"from":"Grover","to":"hbase.apache.org/forum/#!forum/s2graph","label":"post","props":{},"timestamp":1444360152480},
    {"from":"Kermit","to":"www.playframework.com","label":"post","props":{},"timestamp":1444360152481},
    {"from":"Oscar","to":"www.scala-lang.org","label":"post","props":{},"timestamp":1444360152482}
  ]
  '
  ```

  Query posts of Big Bird:
  ```
  curl -XPOST localhost:9000/graphs/getEdges -H 'Content-Type: Application/json' -d '
  {
      "srcVertices": [{"serviceName": "KakaoFavorites", "columnName": "userName", "id":"Big Bird"}],
      "steps": [
        {"step": [{"label": "post", "direction": "out", "offset": 0, "limit": 10}]}
      ]
  }
  '
  ```

4. So far, we designed a label schema for your user relation data ```friends``` and ```post``` as well as stored some sample edges.

  While doing so, we have also prepared ourselves for our timeline query!

  The following two-step query will return ULRs for Elmo's timeline, which are posts of Elmo's friends:

  ```
  curl -XPOST localhost:9000/graphs/getEdges -H 'Content-Type: Application/json' -d '
  {
      "srcVertices": [{"serviceName": "KakaoFavorites", "columnName": "userName", "id":"Elmo"}],
      "steps": [
        {"step": [{"label": "friends", "direction": "out", "offset": 0, "limit": 10}]},
        {"step": [{"label": "post", "direction": "out", "offset": 0, "limit": 10}]}
      ]
  }
  '
  ```

  Also try Cookie Monster's timeline:
  ```
  curl -XPOST localhost:9000/graphs/getEdges -H 'Content-Type: Application/json' -d '
  {
      "srcVertices": [{"serviceName": "KakaoFavorites", "columnName": "userName", "id":"Cookie Monster"}],
      "steps": [
        {"step": [{"label": "friends", "direction": "out", "offset": 0, "limit": 10}]},
        {"step": [{"label": "post", "direction": "out", "offset": 0, "limit": 10}]}
      ]
  }
  '
  ```

The above example is by no means a full-blown social network timeline, but it gives you an idea on how to represent, store and query relations with S2Graph.
