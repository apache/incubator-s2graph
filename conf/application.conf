# HBase
# place your local/remote hbase cluster's zookeeper quorum,

# local retry number
# when write-write conflict occur, then S2Graph will retry as much as max.retry.number times with
# exponential backoff. max.back.off will be used maximum backoff time.
#max.retry.number=100

# Future cache.
# when 'cacheTTL' hint is given on query, then S2Graph will squash all requests on same vertex for
# `cacheTTL` time. this reduce requests on same key in backend storage significantly.
# to squash all requests on same vertex, S2Graph use simple local LRU cache(guava) and these configs are for
# setting LRU cache on local memory.

# Local Cache
# S2Graph store metadata from metastore in local LRU cache(guava) to reduce requests into metastore.
#cache.ttl.seconds=60
#cache.max.size=100000

# Kafka
# if kafka.metadata.broker.list is set, then S2Graph publish all incomming requests into kafka
# so that OLAP query can be run on HDFS file.

# Meta Store
# S2Graph store metadata in JDBC-Compliant Databases(default H2, others may include MYSQL, Postgresql, etc).
# ex) to use mysql as metastore, change db.default.driver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
#     and db.default.url to point to jdbc connection.
